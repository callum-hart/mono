# Example UI - YouTube

- Build new YouTube design using mono
- Light + dark theme
- Responsive `bound`
- XPs, see how mono handles XPs *(mock XPs using query params i.e localhost:8000/youtube.html?theme=dark&ads=disabled)*
- Use Complete-Me for search input to demo `--overthrow` motive.
- Build more interactions / functionality than fb example *(which is rather static)* - since this opens up more use|edge-cases.
