/**
 * Todo: investigate design pattern(s) that allow styles to be organised in a way
 * in which overrides can be determined.
 *
 * Poor structure leads to:
 *
 *  - styles being applied from different contexts
 *  - different ways of targeting an element using different selectors
 *
 * There are different types of style:
 *
 * - element: styles applied to HTML elements
 * - location: styles coupled to structure of HTML
 * - composite: styles combined using multiple classes
 * - stateful: styles applied when a condition is met
 *
 *
 * Ideas:
 *
 * - ban element styles, styles should be applied using a class/id
 * - ban composition in regards to applying multiple classes to an element
 * - single way of targeting an element
 * - represent location styles with BEM, could BEM be enforced?
 * - store shared styles in constants (class="*button")
 * - store shared styles in variables (detached rule-sets in LESS, @extends in SASS)
