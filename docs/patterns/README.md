# Design Patterns

- [Selector Types](SelectorTypes.md)
- [Shorthand Appropriately](ShorthandAppropriately.md)
- [Negation](Negation.md)
- [Discrete Breakpoints](DiscreteBreakpoints.md)
- [Constants](Constants.md)

Whilst presented separately itâ€™s important to note that the design patterns work just as well together and they do alone. Patterns can work in conjunction, each focussed on their own role in helping to avoid needless overrides.
