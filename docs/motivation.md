# Motivation

Mono was born out of my own fustration.

Whilst working on different CSS codebases I realised all shared similar issues. A common trait became clear: **CSS development is expensive** - it's fragile, labour intensive & thus time consuming.

The typical CSS workflow amounted to:

1. **Hunting:** Locate where a style derives from & identify who sets it.
2. **Reasoning:** Understand why a style exists.
3. **Analysing:** Ascertain what impact adding / changing / removing a style will have.
4. **Friction:** Compete with specificity, cascade & importance when making a change.

Four steps to make one change is **exhausting**, and more importantly **not scalable**. The bigger codebases grew the worse maintaining their CSS became.

I thought there must be a better way!
