# Proof of Concepts

There are three proof of concepts (POC) that use the mocked language and demonstrate the design patterns. If you only look at one Iâ€™d recommend YouTube, since it's the most comprehensive.

## Facebook

The first project built with mono. It has an intricate UI which provided a good testing ground for [types]() and [modifiers]().

## Responsive Grid

An example of using [discrete breakpoints]() to build responsive layouts.

## YouTube

The latest project built with mono. A good example of theming, responsiveness, interactions and stateful user interfaces.
