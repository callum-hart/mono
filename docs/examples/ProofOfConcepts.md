# Proof of Concepts

There are three proof of concepts (POC) built using Sass. Each demonstrate mono design patterns, whilst providing a tangible way of exploring the language.

If you only look at one [POC] I recommend YouTube, since it's the most comprehensive.

## Facebook

The first project built with mono. It has an intricate UI which provided a good testing ground for **types and modifiers**.

## Responsive Grid

An example of using **discrete breakpoints** to build responsive layouts.

## YouTube

The latest project built with mono. A good showcase of theming, responsiveness, interactions and stateful user interfaces.
