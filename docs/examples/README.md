Before building monos compiler I wanted to test my assumptions first. Not only did this save time it allowed ideas to develop further. It also prevented implementation details and constraints hindering design decisions.

This was achieved by mocking monos language using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and then pretending the design patterns and language constructs were being enforced by an imaginary compiler. Sass provided enough syntax sugar to offer a tangible way of testing theories in practice.
